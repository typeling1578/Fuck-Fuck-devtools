# Fuck-Fuck-devtools
A script that breaks the trick to detect opening developer tools for Firefox and its forks.

## Setup
First of all, you need to change some settings in your browser.

In about:config, set `devtools.toolbox.host` to `window` and toggle `devtools.debugger.skip-pausing` to `true`.

Then install [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and install the script from [this link](https://github.com/typeling1578/Fuck-Fuck-devtools/raw/main/fuck-fuck-devtools.user.js).

**If you find sites that are still detected, feel free to raise an issue.**

## Note!!!
**This script has no effect on Chromium-based browsers.**
